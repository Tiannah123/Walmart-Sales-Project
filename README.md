Data Cleaning Practice: 
Using Python, R, Excel, or another data cleaning tool of your choice, clean the data to meet the following criteria:
Data is sorted first by store number (ascending) and second by date (ascending)
Date is in the format MM-DD-YYYY
Weekly Sales is rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places
Temperature is rounded to the nearest whole number
Fuel Price is rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places
CPI is rounded to the nearest 3 decimal places
Unemployment is rounded to the nearest 3 decimal places
Ensure that there is no missing data

Business Questions:
Which holidays affect weekly sales the most?
Which stores in the dataset have the lowest and highest unemployment rate?  What factors do you think are impacting the unemployment rate?
Is there any correlation between CPI and Weekly Sales?  How does the correlation differ when the Holiday Flag is 0 versus when the Holiday Flag is 1?
Why do you think Fuel Price is included in this dataset?  What conclusions can be made about Fuel Price compared to any of the other fields?
